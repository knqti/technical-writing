# What is Wholesale?

Wholesale is the business of buying items from manufacturers and selling to other businesses. Wholesale companies ("Wholesalers") typically buy in large quantities and sell to retail companies ("Retailers") in smaller quantities.

In this overview, we explore the wholesale concept. Ideal readers include:

- Non-business professionals
- Undergraduate business students
- Anyone who's curious how the bacon gets to their table

After finishing this document, you'll understand the basic wholesale process.

> Note: Many of the examples below refer to physical goods. However, the concepts and ideas can be applied to services too.

# Supply-chain

Similar to how a chain is made up of links, a supply-chain is made up of multiple companies that move items along from manufacturer to consumer. Each supply-chain link falls under three broad categories:

- Producer
- Transporter
- Distributor

Wholesalers usually fall within the Distributor category. However, the wholesale process requires the entire supply-chain, so most Wholesalers play a role within each category. A big part of a Wholesaler's job is to oversee, if not directly manage, their supply-chain.

## Producer

All items are produced somewhere, whether it's a farm that grows vegetables or a manufacturer that weaves blankets. Producers take raw materials and turn them into finished items for the consumer.

Producers also tend to specialize and make a lot of a single type of item. By doing so, they take advantage of economies of scale to increase their profit. Economies of scale is the process of decreasing costs as the size of an operation increases. For example:

> *Imagine you decide to start a T-shirt business. Thread is a key raw material. As your business grows, you need to buy more thread. You tell your vendor that you'll buy twice as much thread each month, but only if they give you a discount. They agree and now your raw material cost per T-shirt decreases, resulting in a net profit increase.*
> 
> *Your business continues to grow. After months of strategizing and testing, your employees develop a new packaging system. This system reduces storage cost per T-shirt, resulting in a net profit increase.* 

Wholesalers can buy directly from Producers or through brokers.

## Transporter

Moving items along the supply-chain is key to the entire wholesale process. A single logistical mishap can delay a delivery by weeks or months.

Transporters generally specialize by route and item type. By doing so, they take advantage of economies of scale.

Transporters may deliver:

- raw materials from a natural location to an assembly factory.
- items from a factory to a port.
- containers across oceans.
- pallets from a warehouse to a retail store.
- parcels from a store to a consumer's doorstep.

The list goes on for every item category that exists.

Wholesalers can contract directly with Transporters or through brokers.

## Distributor

Distributors are the last stop before an item reaches a Retailer's shelves. They organize, store, and deliver items. 

Distributors usually receive items in the following configuration (from smallest to largest):

- :arrow_down: **Retail-package**. An item that's ready for consumer purchase. It can be a single unit (e.g., 1 milk jug) or a multi-pack/set (e.g., 12-pack soda/3-piece luggage). 
- :arrow_down: **Master carton**. Multiple retail-package items are packed inside a master carton.
- :arrow_down: **Pallets/skids**. Multiple master cartons are stacked on top of a pallet.
- :arrow_down: **Containers**. Multiple pallets are placed inside a container.

Most Retailers don't want to, or can't, handle containers of a single item. Instead, Distributors are responsible for holding inventory and delivering items in an acceptable configuration (commonly master cartons or pallets) to Retailers.

Wholesalers are typically Distributors themselves. There can even be multiple Distributors within the same supply-chain. For example:

> *Awesome Brand recently went viral. Their pet rocks are the hottest toy of the year. Awesome Brand only wants to develop new pet rocks; they don't want to deal with sales, so they contract with XYZ Inc. as an authorized distributor. Now, all Awesome Brand pet rocks must be purchased through XYZ Inc.*
>
> *XYZ Inc. only sells a minimum of 5,000 pet rocks at a time - to the dismay of toy stores everywhere. As a result, other Wholesalers buy from XYZ Inc. in large quantities, and then resell to toy stores in smaller quantities.*

# Common Scenarios

The following are examples of common wholesale scenarios. They are not exclusive to each other. A Wholesaler can be involved in different scenarios at the same time.

## In-House Brand

A Wholesaler owns their brand. They buy from Producers and hire brokers to contract Transporters. The Wholesaler stocks and sells their inventory to Retailers.

## Private Label

A Retailer wants to expand into a different item category with their brand. They contract with a Wholesaler experienced in the desired category. The Wholesaler buys from Producers, contracts Transporters, and delivers the new items (with brand specifications) to the Retailer.

## General Merchandise

A Wholesaler stocks items from many different categories. They act as a "one-stop shop" for Retailers. The Wholesaler buys their best-selling items directly from Producers and hires brokers to buy the rest.

# Sidenote on Brokers and Agents

Brokers and agents exist throughout the supply-chain. Brokers connect customers with vendors; brokers never own the goods/service. Agents act on behalf of and represent their employer.

Some common types of brokers and agents include:

- Trading companies
- Quality control companies
- Sourcing companies
- Freight/logistics companies
- Customs import/export companies
- Licensing companies

# Conclusion

When done right, the wholesale process efficiently supplies items to consumers. A successful Wholesaler continually monitors their supply-chain and makes adjustments as needed.

You can explore how wholesale impacts your life with any item you've purchased. There's usually a label on the back packaging that says "Distributed by" or "Imported by". Search that company on the internet. You'll find clues as to what role they played within the wholesale process.
